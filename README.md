## About this Git repository

This repository holds the **plan and documentation** for the Medical Supply Web Project. It is organised into **two branches**:

| Branch | Purpose | Main contents |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **master** | Main branch — technical documents and project overview | [Overview.md](Overview.md), [docs/](docs/) (Executive Summary, PRD, Technical Architecture, Business Logic, Data Model, Wireframes, NFRs, Timeline, Legal/Commercial, Risk & Assumptions). This README. |
| **NDA** | NDA documents | [NDA/](NDA/) folder: NDA template(s) and instructions for use when sharing confidential project information with development companies, clients, or partners. |

- Use **master** for day-to-day work on the project plan and for sharing technical documentation.  
- Use the **NDA** branch when you need to share or work only on Non-Disclosure Agreement materials (e.g. with legal or external parties before sharing full technical docs).

**To switch branches:**  
`git checkout master`  
`git checkout NDA`

## What is this project?

The **Medical Supply Web Project** is a web-based platform that allows:

- **Government** to register drug types, issue and revoke licenses, and manage participants.  
- **Manufacturers** to register medicine units (with a unique UUID) and transfer them to pharmacies.  
- **Pharmacies** to receive units and transfer them to citizens.  
- **Citizens** (and the public) to verify a medicine by its UUID and see its status and history.

All content is about the **web project only** (backend, database, REST API, frontend).
